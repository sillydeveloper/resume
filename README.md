# An autogenerating CV

This is a version of my resume that is built in Markdown, and uses Grunt.js to auto build it into a simple web page and as a PDF file.

### Getting started 

Start up your own resume editing session! Connect with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)!

    sudo npm install
    grunt

### Why did I do this?

I don't like maintaining my resume. So I'm automating it!

### But I don't like maintaining my resume either

Feel free to clone this repository and replace my markdown. If there's interest I'll abstract it further.

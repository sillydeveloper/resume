I was brought in to help Postano launch version 2.0 of their social platform for brands, events and sports teams, which Postano launched successfully in November of 2013. We've had two major updates since then, and a lot of little improvements. My goal was to help them deliver the best possible experience to their customers while stabilizing their software development process and making sure products were meeting market needs.

* Architected and implemented Postano's custom built embeddable JavaScript web software into an extensible framework, providing maintainability and rapid development of new products
* Built a modal, wizard-centric social management interface using AngularJS' services, directives, a custom router, and MVVM patterns
* Used Node.js and Redis to act not only as a web server for the AngularJS application, but also as an API proxy to provide additional services like authentication, data normalization, caching, and batch processing for both the AngularJS app and the embeddable client
* Used the lodash / underscore templating engine to apply layouts to social media posts from a variety of sources
* Gave customers a social data analytics dashboard using NVD3.js for line charts, D3.js for bubble charts, and a custom tag cloud
* Introduced unit testing using Mocha for both the embedded JavaScript framework and AngularJS
* Brought in API design processes to keep teams moving forward immediately after an API designed
* Implemented version management to keep Postano's master branch stable at all times
